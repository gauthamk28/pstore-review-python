# pstore-review-python
This repository is inspired from the [play-scrape](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/play-scrape) . It was giving output in JSON format and only Italian reviews were generated.I made some changes inorder to  scrape English reviews and also made the output in both **csv** and **JSON** formats.
Credits goes to [RiccardoAncarani](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani)
